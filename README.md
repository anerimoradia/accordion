## File Structure

```
accordion/
├── index.html      # Main HTML file
├── styles.css      # Stylesheet with all styling
├── scripts.js      # JavaScript functionality
└── README.md       # Project documentation
```

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Semantic markup
- **CSS3** - Modern styling with transitions and animations
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No frameworks or libraries required


## How It Works

1. **JavaScript** listens for clicks on accordion headers
2. When clicked, it toggles the `active` class on the clicked item
3. All other items automatically close (removing their `active` class)
4. **CSS** handles the visual transition using `max-height` animations
5. The icon rotates when an item is active
